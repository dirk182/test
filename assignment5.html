		<h3>Types of Thanksgiving Turkey</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Free Range</strong>: According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, free-range turkeys have been allowed access to the outdoors. More robust turkey flavor and substantial texture than coop-raised turkeys.</li>
			<li><strong>Self-Basted</strong>: These turkeys have been pumped with anything from broth to butter, including water, salt, or even chicken fat. The result, producers claim, is added flavor and moisture.</li>
			<li><strong>Organic</strong>: Turkeys bearing the organic label are raised free of antibiotics and growth hormones, are given access to the outdoors (also qualifying them as free-range), and are fed organic feed, which by law contains no genetically modified grains, pesticides or herbicides, or animal by-products. HIGH turkey flavor.</li>
			<li><strong>Natural</strong>: Anything labeled "natural" must, by law, be minimally processed and contain no artificial ingredients, coloring, or preservatives.  Important: read the label on these types of turkeys to determine what the manufacturer determines "natural."</li>
			<li><strong>Kosher</strong>: Turkeys raised and processed under rabbinical supervision and in accordance with strict Jewish dietary law.</li>
			<li><strong>Heritage</strong>: These turkey breeds are direct descendants of the first domesticated turkeys raised by the English settlers. They tend to have a robust turkey flavor-most noticeably in the dark meat-and a moist, chewy, almost beeflike texture and a higher price tag.</li>
